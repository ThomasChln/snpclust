Description: SNP selection based on PCA contributions and summarization of nearby correlated SNPs by estimating haplotypes using the SHAPEIT software, in order to perform genome wide unsupervised clustering and enhance non-ancestry signals. Developed to study systemic autoimmune diseases in the IMI PRECISESADS project.
